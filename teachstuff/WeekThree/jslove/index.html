<p>JavaScript lesson structure: -In order to understand web development, it is essential to understand the basic principles
of programming.</p>

<p>What is a program? -"A list of computer instructions that tell a computer what to do."</p>

<p>What is JavaScript? - The language was introduced in 1995 and used to create programs in Netscape (Netscape was a browser
similar to Google Chrome and Internet Explorer). - Not to be confused with Java. JavaScript has almost nothing to do with
Java except that they're both programming languages.</p>

<p>JS has 6 data types</p>
<li>numbers</li>
<li>strings</li>
<li>Booleans</li>
<li>objects</li>
<li>functions</li>
<li>undefined</li>

    <h1>Numbers and Arithmetic With JavaScript</h1>

    <script type="text/javascript">

        'use strict';
        // 'use strict' tells the browser to to use strict mode. In strict mode you
        // can't use undeclared variables. It makes it easier to write secure JS.
        // Prevents us from writing bad syntax.

        /* 
            There are 6 data types in JavaScript. The first we will cover is numbers.
            1. Numbers
            2. Strings
            3. Functions
            4. Objects
            5. Booleans 
            6. Undefined

        document.write(3);

        document.write('<br>');
        document.write('<br>');

        document.write(3.23423);

        document.write('<br>');
        document.write('<br>');

        // Numbers are often used for arithmetic ( +, -, *, / )
        document.write(3 * 5);

        document.write('<br>');
        document.write('<br>');

        // JS runs arithmatic using mathematic order of operations
        // Think of PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction)
        // When there is more than one + or - sign, it's computed from left to right. Same for * and /

        document.write(3 + 2 * 2 / 2); //5

        document.write('<br>');
        document.write('<br>');

        document.write((3 + 2) * 2); //10
